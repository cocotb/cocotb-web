author: Philipp Wagner

Today, we're announcing the cocotb unconference as part of the [ORConf Sunday Sessions](https://www.orconf.org) in Munich, Germany on Sept 17, 2023.

The cocotb user community is growing rapidly.
Every day, cocotb users write verification code, explore new use cases, and improve on existing ones.
Is there something you have figured out when using cocotb?
Is there something you've been wondering about, or something you'd like to have a discussion on?
Are you not yet using cocotb but interested in in-depth discussions with the maintainers and other users?
Then you're fortunate: the cocotb project is hosting an unconference as part of the ORConf Sunday Sessions.
Many cocotb maintainers will be there as well!

We won't have a fixed agenda: instead, everyone is invited to bring their own discussions topics, which we'll then discuss either in a large group, or in smaller breakout groups.
The cocotb unconference will be an interactive event, tailored on the fly to the interests of its attendees.

When and where? Sunday, Sept 17, 2023 in Munich, Germany as part of [ORConf](https://www.orconf.org). The exact location will be announced later.

Interested in joining? Please [register *now* for ORConf](https://orconf.org/), even if you're only planning to attend the cocotb unconference. Registration is free, with optional professional tickets available. *Please consider buying a professional ticket*, the proceeds are funding the FOSSi Foundation and with it the cocotb project, e.g., to pay for our continuous integration setup.

ORConf is an excellent opportunity to present your company to a highly technical audience of hardware engineers, and some sponsorship opportunities are still available.
