Here's an idea for you: grab a cup of your favourite beverage, and click on this link:
[cocotb user survey 2023](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScVleNw24McTAcSkY2g4T8lsuLJgIkbe4uZo0Rv6Efpl51GaA/viewform).

Cocotb is free to download and use for anyone without registration.
That's why we need your help: how are you using cocotb?
What are you enjoying?
What do you think could improve?
And of course the most basic question: how many cocotb users are there?

The survey should take no longer than 10 minutes to complete.
Please reach out to Philipp at philipp@fossi-foundation.org if you have further comments or questions.

We will keep the survey open until June 4, 2023.
Please distribute it to your colleagues and cocotb friends!
